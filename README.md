## Bash-shell
# Notes

cntl o [enter] + cntl x-----for nano text editor
esc wq --- for vi/vim
i for insert in vi/vim
 expr for doing calculation 
another way of doing that is 
echo $((expression)) e.g echo $((10 + 2))
- `pwd` and (pwd) can be used to achieve the same thing e.g 
echo My current directory is: `pwd`  or
echo My current directory is: $(pwd)
